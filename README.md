# RAREAI
Rare diseases often go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years due to limited awareness, specialist access, and subtle early symptoms. We're solving the problem of delayed diagnosis by using AI to detect rare diseases early through facial, voice, and symptom analysisâ€”bringing faster, smarter care to those who need it most.
